Instructions to build:

Clone the fpga_driver_build repository.

Modify Makefile so that KDIR points to your driver headers

Source the xilinx environment settings:

source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/<<version>>/settings64.sh   
**use settings32.sh on 32-bit operating systems**


Build the driver with make

make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-
	**Use the architecture and compiler for your target**
	***You can ignore any warnings about .o.cmd files***
