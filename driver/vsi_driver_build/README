Download and copy vsi_driver_2016_4.tar.gz into the directory where you would like to build the driver.
Extract the tarball:

tar xvzf vsi_driver_2016_4.tar.gz


Modify Makefile so that KDIR points to your driver headers

Source the xilinx environment settings:

source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2016.4/settings64.sh   
**use settings32.sh on 32-bit operating systems**


Build the driver with make
